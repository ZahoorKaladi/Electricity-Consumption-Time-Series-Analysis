This project analyzes the electricity consumption of various home appliances over time. It uses a time series analysis approach to forecast future electricity consumption using historical data. The dataset includes usage information for different appliances, and the forecast is made for the next 7 days.

## **Features**

- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzes electricity consumption patterns over time.
- **Forecasting**: Uses the ARIMA model to predict future electricity usage.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the total and appliance-specific electricity consumption trends.
- **Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and formats the data for analysis.
